A proof of concept work which will use Terraform and AWS to construct a simple webserver with healthcheck.

@TODO List
- job memory on breakdown of TF module structure
- further define how I am interpreting the project with greater detail
    - currently: VPC, subnets, SGs, EC2, healthcheck
- remember to do final refactor into smaller modules if necessary
- tf fmt !!
- extrapolate overacrhing config, add tags (?)
